For Your mercy never fails me

All my days, I've been held in Your hands

From the moment that I wake up

Until I lay my head

Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

With every breath that I am able

You have led me through the fire

In darkest night You are close like no other

And I have lived in the goodness of God
