Verse 2 
Dmadd9                                        Fmaj7
Drench my soul as mercy and grace unfold
                      C                        Bb        A7b13
I hunger and thirst, I hunger and thirst
        Dmadd9                                Fmaj7
With arms stretched wide, I know You hear my cry
                      C                             Bb       A7b13
Speak to me now, speak to me now

Chorus

I surrender, I surrender

I want to know You more, I want to know You more
