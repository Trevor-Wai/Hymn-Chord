Verse 1:
G                        C
Worthy of every song we could ever sing
G/B                      C
Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring
G                        C
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
G/B                      C
We live for You, oh, we live for You

Verse 2:
G                        C
Jesus, the Name above every other name
G/B                      C
Jesus, the only One who could ever save
G                        C
Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
G/B                      C
We live for You, oh, we live for You

Chorus:
C                                Am
Holy, there is no one like You
                        G/D
There is none beside You
                      Em7
Open up my eyes in wonder
C                                Am
And show me who You are
                        G/D
And fill me with Your heart
                      Em7                                          C
And lead me in Your love to those around me

Bridge:
        C               D                Em
And I will build my life upon Your love
          G/B
It is a firm foundation
        C               D                Em
And I will put my trust in You alone
          G/B
And I will not be shaken
