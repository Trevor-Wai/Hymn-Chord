E                              C#m
I see a generation   Rising up to take their place

With selfless faith   With selfless faith

We're on our knees   We're on our knees

A                                           B
Heal my heart and make it clean

Open up my eyes to the things unseen

Show me how to love like You have loved me
A                                                   B
Break my heart for what breaks Yours
E                                         C#m
Everything I am for Your Kingdom's cause
A                                B                C#m (A)
As I walk from earth into eternity
